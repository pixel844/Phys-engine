# Phys-engine
a small 2 dimensional rust based physics engine with bevy used as a backend for both visual and input into the engine.

I finished this project in about 6/8 days in around the start of the new year of 2026, this might have been one of my longest projects yet in rust with it being able to succesfully reach my goals for what i wanted to achieve with it.

In the end i got solid grades for it in physics class, sadly however i lost my design document of this as it was lost when i transitioned back into windows.
